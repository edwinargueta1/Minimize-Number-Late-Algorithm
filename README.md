# Minimize-Number-Late-Algorithm
MInimize Max Lateness Algorithms
Overview: The MinimizeNumberLate problem has input of a set of jobs (each with a processing time and
a deadline {(pi, di} N i=1} that need to be scheduled on a single processor. A solution will place the jobs in some
order and will be judged based on the number of jobs that do not complete by their deadline. Note this problem
is similar to MinimizeMaximumLateness, but has a different goal. Your program will test the performance
of several greedy algorithms.
